# odin-project-beginnings
This will start off as just an HTML and CSS page. Over time it may grow and grow.... 

#####1. Make sure you have Git installed on your computer.
  
  + Use either your command line **(recommended)** or one of GitHub's GUI clients
  + `git clone git@github.com:bryantt23/odin-project-beginnings.git`
  + Change into that directory in the command line

#####2. Create a branch 
  
  + `git checkout -b "modify-index-file"`
  + Replace text in quotes with a descriptive branch name
  + Make sure you are on the branch by typing in `git status`
  + Make your changes then run `git status` in the command line to remind yourself of what you did

#####3. If everything works, commit the changes by typing in the command line 
  
  + `git add .` This adds all of the files you modified
  + Next type in the command line, `git commit -am "update index file by adding paragraphs"`
  + Replace text in quotes with a descriptive commit name, make sure to use the imperative tense (*update* not updated)

#####4. Switch to the master branch type in the command line 
  
  + `git checkout master`
  + To merge the branch you committed, type in the command line `git merge modify-index-file`
or whatever the branch name was
  + Finally to push the change, type in the command line `git push -u origin master`
